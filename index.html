            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>At Centennial High School, I was a member of the Web Development Club board, where I helped create engaging presentations to teach web development concepts along with general management of the club.</p>
            <p>I co-founded the Game Development Club at Broadneck High School to create a space for people interested in computers and software development. It is also an officially registered <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>, which gives the club support and opportunities. In the first year, we had 9 members who met weekly both inside and outside of school to showcase their work and give presentations about topics like creating engaging games and versioning code with Git. Even after changing schools, I've continued to keep in touch, providing ideas and feedback as well as mentoring and guiding new leaders.</p>
            <p>While a member of the Broadneck Robotics Club, I was the technical lead, which meant that along with writing the code and collaborating on my team's robot design, I was responsible for helping all others teams with their code, ensuring it was functional for each competition.</p>

            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>I have worked primarily with JavaScript and Node.js to create full-stack web apps, but I am also comfortable in several other languages, including Python and Java. With regards to software tools, I have experience in Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Copilot, among other commonly used industry software.</p>
            <p>With regards to Linux and management of systems, competing in Cyberpatriots gave me knowledge of securing Linux-based operating systems, while using Linux on my personal device as well as different distros on my servers (OpenSuse, Ubuntu, Fedora) has taught me the fundamentals of the operating system and tasks commonly associated with it, like web hosting.</p>

            <h1>Clubs</h1>
            <p>At Centennial High School, I was a member of the foremost team in the club, which competed up to the State Round, and missed reaching the Semifinals by only 6 points. After the Cyberpatriots season, I lead a team of our best members for eCitadel, a similar cybersecurity competition open to high school and college students. Despite having one teammate drop out at the last second, we tied for 61st place.</p>
            <p>As mentioned before, while I was in the Broadneck Robotics Club, I worked with most of the club's code. Throughout the 2023-2024 season, we participated in multiple local competitions, learning from our losses to improve our robot. Our efforts paid off near the end of the season, when we made it into the VEX Robotics state competition.</p>

            <p>I've created multiple open source projects, which, while not actively maintained, have taught me a lot of programming skills, as well as how to create and manage projects. A major one still under development is <a href="https://fetchcv.hnasheralneam.dev">FetchCV</a>, a developer profile platform. I also recently made an online multiplayer game, <a href="https://mediumrare.hnasheralneam.dev">Medium Rare</a> with some friends for a hackathon, and am still developing it. These are just the highlights, there are many newer and smaller projects on my <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam">GitHub</a>.</p>
